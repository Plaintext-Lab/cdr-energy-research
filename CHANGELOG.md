# Changelog

All notable changes to this research repo.

## [Unreleased]

### Removed
- Retired the custom cross-repository agent delivery gate; native GitHub rules
  and repository-specific CI remain in force.
- Removed Repo Assist and its dedicated workflows, gh-aw agent tooling, generated
  locks, cached imports, and repository-only credential references.

### Fixed

- Replaced the blocked third-party release action with GitHub CLI so catalogue publishing complies with the repository's allowed-actions policy.
  Preserved dated releases, same-day asset replacement and the latest download URL, with offline publishing regression tests running in CI.
- Distinguished the generated EME and authoritative AER shared-base-URI counts,
  documented the Radian endpoint, and aligned rate-limit guidance with the
  base-URI throttle.
- Shared PRD endpoints now deduplicate retailers by `cdrBrand`, filter plan
  lists by that brand identity, serialize requests per base URI, and exclude
  stale mixed-brand detail files from catalogue extraction.
- `publish-catalogue.yml`: raised the `publish` job `timeout-minutes` from 60 to
  180. The job always runs a cold `--refresh` sweep, which the committed v2 sweep
  records at 6036.1s (~101 min); the old 60-min ceiling cancelled the run before
  the build + release steps, so no catalogue was ever published.
- `scripts/cdr_full_sweep_v2.py`: `REPO_ROOT` is derived from the script location
  instead of a hardcoded absolute path, so the scheduled sweep works in any
  checkout (CI, fresh clone).
- `scripts/cdr_full_sweep_v2.py`: a plan-list request that fails part-way through
  pagination now records a `list_error` (previously the partial list was treated
  as a clean sweep), so the publish gate refuses to release a catalogue missing
  that retailer's later-page plans.
- Added deterministic pull-request validation for Python sources and committed JSON research data.

### Changed

- Updated shared repository checks and matching workflow documentation to the reviewed v1.1.0 release.
- Adopted versioned shared repository checks and tailored documentation/agent skills while retaining project-specific validation.
- Replaced Linear tracking rules with GitHub Issues and pull requests for local and Cursor Cloud agents.
  The user-level Development Project must not be used for work tracking.

### Added
- Branding: logo, wordmark, and social-preview assets in `assets/`. The README
  wordmark uses a theme-aware `<picture>` (`prefers-color-scheme`) with a
  light-ink dark-mode SVG variant (`logo-wordmark-dark.svg`) so the wordmark and
  tagline stay legible on GitHub's dark canvas, not just on white.
- Catalogue publish pipeline: `scripts/build_catalogue.py` trims the swept cache
  to a compact residential-electricity catalogue (`dist/catalogue.json.gz` +
  `dist/manifest.json`, schema_version 1) for the PriceHawk HA integration to
  download and rank against. Stdlib-only; reuses the v2 sweep's
  `is_residential_electricity`/`load_json` helpers. Builds only from each
  retailer's CURRENT plan list (`_planlist*.json`), so stale or delisted plans
  lingering in a warm detail cache never leak into the catalogue.
- Daily `.github/workflows/publish-catalogue.yml` (03:00 AEST + manual dispatch):
  runs the national sweep with `--refresh` (live registry + lists + details),
  builds the catalogue, and publishes it as a GitHub Release with a dated tag and
  `--latest` so the stable `releases/latest/download/catalogue.json.gz`
  URL always resolves to the newest build. Refuses to publish an empty catalogue
  (0-plan sweep fails the job) or a partial one (a `Verify sweep completeness`
  step plus the sweep's own non-zero exit block release on any list/detail
  failure).
- `scripts/cdr_full_sweep_v2.py --refresh` flag: bypasses every cache and
  re-fetches the EME registry, plan lists, and plan details live; writes a
  machine-readable `_summary_v2.json` (list/plan-detail failure counts +
  `complete` flag) and exits non-zero when the sweep is incomplete.
- `tests/test_build_catalogue.py`, `tests/test_sweep_summary.py`,
  `tests/test_sweep_fetch.py` + vendored `tests/fixtures/cdr/*.json` +
  `requirements-dev.txt` (pytest): residential filtering, trimmed-entry schema,
  `electricityContract` pass-through, gzip round-trip, manifest counts, dedup,
  empty-cache guard, current-list filtering of stale details, the completeness
  summary gate, refresh cache-bypass, and partial-list-failure detection. The
  suite is self-contained (no external fixture paths).
- Continuous integration now compiles the research scripts and validates every tracked JSON dataset on pull requests.
- Initial repository structure with docs/, data/, scripts/, cache/
- v1 shape catalog (78 retailers, 10,266 plans, 1,724 signatures) at `docs/shape-catalog-v1.md`
- v2 sweep script using EME refdata2 (117 retailers) + comprehensive field probe at `scripts/cdr_full_sweep_v2.py`
- AER PDF (Jan 2026) authoritative retailer registry at `data/aer-base-uris-jan2026.pdf`
- AER fact sheet (Feb 2025) at `data/aer-fact-sheet-feb2025.docx`
- EME refdata2 snapshot at `data/eme-refdata.json` (117 orgs + 72 brokers)
- Defensive parser implementation contract at `docs/parser-spec.md`
- API operational reference at `docs/api-reference.md`
- 15 open CDS standards-maintenance Energy issues catalog at `docs/upcoming-changes.md`
- Registry source comparison (EME vs AER vs jxeeno vs ACCC) at `docs/registry-comparison.md`
- Operations runbook at `docs/operations.md`

### Findings
- 117 CDR-enrolled retailers (vs jxeeno's 78); 39 missing from prior probe
- 20 base URIs are shared across multiple brands (Energy Locals + 6 sub-brands; OVO Energy + 2 sub-brands; etc.)
- ACCC Register API is BROKEN for energy discovery per SM#561 (4 years unresolved)
- EME refdata2 is the richest metadata source (ABN, contacts, logos, bill URLs)
- All daily supply charges live at `tariffPeriod[0].dailySupplyCharge` (string, GST-EXCLUSIVE)
- 1,724 distinct shape signatures across 10,266 plans — extreme long tail
- EV-overlay plans (AGL Night Saver EV, Origin 360 EV, etc.) are mis-classified — workaround: detect zero rates in TOU plans
- Solar Sharer Offer (SSO) plans land 1 July 2026 with no spec value (SM#719)

## v2 sweep results (2026-05-16)

- 117/117 retailers reachable (vs 78 in v1)
- 17,779 plans fetched (+73% vs v1)
- 5,087 distinct shape signatures (3× v1's 1,724)
- 148 EV-overlay candidates (zero-rate within TOU plans) — SM#710 concrete count
- 0 failures across 17,779 plan detail fetches
- 7.7 min wall-clock (cache-warm)
- 167 MB cache

### Enum surprises (vs spec)

- `discounts[].type` spec value `OTHER` **NEVER used** in 3,450 obs
- `discounts[].methodUType` spec value `percentOverThreshold` **NEVER used**
- `discounts[].category` spec value `GUARANTEED_DISCOUNT` **NEVER used**
- `fees[].term` 10 of 13 spec values **NEVER used** (only FIXED, PERCENT_OF_BILL, ANNUAL observed)
- `fees[].type` rare values rarely used: EXIT, ESTABLISHMENT, MEMBERSHIP, CONTRIBUTION
- AGL has **3 separate org records** (AGL Sales, AGL Retail Energy, AGL) all sharing `/agl/` cdrCode
- Origin has 3 org records (Electricity, LPG, Retail Limited)
- Energy Locals has 4 org records (incl. EL Retail Energy with multiple variations)
