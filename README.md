# CDR Energy Research

Comprehensive research and tooling for the Australian Consumer Data Right (CDR) Energy Product Reference Data (PRD) APIs. Used to power [PriceHawk](../pricehawk/) (Home Assistant integration) and inform other energy projects.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- `pytest` for local tests (`pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`)

## Core commands

```bash
python3 scripts/cdr_probe_v1.py
python3 scripts/cdr_full_sweep_v2.py
python3 scripts/build_catalogue.py
python -m compileall -q scripts
python -m pytest tests/ -q
```

## TL;DR — where to start

1. **Read `docs/shape-catalog-v2.md`** for the comprehensive shape inventory.
2. **Read `docs/parser-spec.md`** for the implementation contract.
3. **Read `docs/upcoming-changes.md`** for what to watch (especially Solar Sharer Offer landing 1 July 2026).
4. **Read `docs/api-reference.md`** for the operational HOWTO.
5. **Run `scripts/cdr_full_sweep_v2.py`** to refresh data.
6. **Run `scripts/build_catalogue.py`** to generate `dist/catalogue.json.gz` for consumers.

## Key endpoints

| Purpose | Endpoint | Headers | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Retailer registry | `GET https://api.energymadeeasy.gov.au/refdata2?keys=organisations,thirdParties` | none | 117 orgs + 72 brokers, no auth |
| Plan list | `GET {base}/cds-au/v1/energy/plans?fuelType=ELECTRICITY&type=ALL&effective=CURRENT&page-size=1000&brand={cdrBrand}&updated-since={iso}` | `x-v: 1` | `brand={cdrBrand}` for shared endpoints; `updated-since=` for incremental |
| Plan detail | `GET {base}/cds-au/v1/energy/plans/{planId}` | `x-v: 3` | v2 retired Mar 2025 |

`{base}` is normally `cdr.energymadeeasy.gov.au/<cdrCode>`. The sweep's
deduplicated view of the committed EME snapshot constructs three shared base
URIs hosting nine brands. The authoritative AER registry maps iO Energy to the
Radian base URI instead of its earlier EME record's constructed `/io-energy/`
URI, producing four operational shared base URIs hosting 11 brands.

## Headline findings from the sweeps

- **117 committed retailer records** in the current generated snapshot; the
  corrected sweep deduplicates future regeneration by `cdrBrand`
- **3 shared base URIs hosting 9 brands in generated EME-derived outputs; the
  authoritative AER mapping adds `/radian/`, producing 4 shared base URIs
  hosting 11 brands operationally** — use the `brand=<cdrBrand>` query
  parameter to isolate a co-hosted brand
- **10,266 residential ELEC plans** observed in v1 sweep (78 retailers)
- **1,724 distinct shape signatures** — extreme long tail; top 30 sigs cover only 13% of plans
- **0 retailers 404 on plan detail** when listed — reliability is excellent
- **`tariffPeriod[0].dailySupplyCharge` is the ONLY observed location for daily charges** — other 3 spec locations are 0/10,266
- **`tariffPeriod[0].dailySupplyCharge` is GST-EXCLUSIVE per spec** — most other AmountStrings are GST-inclusive
- **EV-overlay plans (AGL Night Saver EV, Origin 360 EV, Red EV Saver, Three for Free SA) are mis-classified** — they ship as TIME_OF_USE_CONT_LOAD with zero-priced rate rows; spec issue [SM#710](https://github.com/ConsumerDataStandardsAustralia/standards-maintenance/issues/710) tracks the gap
- **Solar Sharer Offer (SSO) plans land 1 July 2026** — government-mandated zero-cost consumption window with daily volume cap, no spec value yet ([SM#719](https://github.com/ConsumerDataStandardsAustralia/standards-maintenance/issues/719))
- **`fit0.scheme=OTHER` IS spec-valid** (despite informal reports otherwise)
- **`incentives.category` enum is `GIFT | ACCOUNT_CREDIT | OTHER`** (not the often-cited DISCOUNT/BONUS/OTHER)

## Sources

| Source | URL | Use |
|---|---|---|
| AER PDF (authoritative registry) | `aer.gov.au/documents/consumer-data-right-energy-retailer-base-uris-and-cdr-brands` | Truth source for brand → base URI mapping |
| EME refdata2 (richest metadata) | `api.energymadeeasy.gov.au/refdata2?keys=organisations,thirdParties` | 117 orgs, ABNs, contacts, logos, bill URLs |
| CDS spec (canonical schema) | `consumerdatastandardsaustralia.github.io/standards/#cdr-energy-api_get-generic-plan-detail` | Field types, enums, mandatory/optional |
| CDS standards-maintenance | `github.com/ConsumerDataStandardsAustralia/standards-maintenance/issues?q=label%3A%22Energy%22` | In-flight schema changes |
| jxeeno community scrape | `github.com/jxeeno/energy-cdr-prd-endpoints` | Auto-updated weekly; **drifts from AER**; uses ACCC Register + EME refdata2 |
| ACCC Register API | `api.cdr.gov.au/cdr-register/v1/energy/data-holders/brands/summary` | Per [SM#561](https://github.com/ConsumerDataStandardsAustralia/standards-maintenance/issues/561), unreliable for energy — `publicBaseUri` flips between PRD and outage URIs based on retailer enrollment status |

## Operational notes

- API is **public**, no auth required for PRD (per AER fact sheet).
- Polite usage: **1 req/sec per base URI**, 12-way parallel across distinct base URIs is fine.
- v1 sweep took **33.5 min** for 78 retailers / 10,266 plans on a residential connection.
- Cache hits make re-runs free. Use `?updated-since=<iso>` for incremental sync (5 min instead of 33 min).
- Spec versions: plan list = v1 (`x-v: 1`), plan detail = v3 (`x-v: 3`). v2 retired March 2025.

## Catalogue output

- Local build output: `dist/catalogue.json.gz` and `dist/manifest.json`
- Scheduled publication: `.github/workflows/publish-catalogue.yml` (daily + manual)
- Stable latest download URL: `https://github.com/Artic0din/cdr-energy-research/releases/latest/download/catalogue.json.gz`
